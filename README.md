# Konstructor

Konstructor is a small gem that gives you multiple
constructors in Ruby.

Use `konstructor` keyword to declare constructors additional to the defaul one:
```ruby
class SomeClass
  konstructor
  def create(val)
    @val = val
  end 
  
  attr_reader :val
end

obj0 = SomeClass.new
obj0.val # nil

obj1 = SomeClass.create(3)
obj1.val # 3
```
It's similar to having overloaded constructors in other languages.

## Installation

Via Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'konstructor' 
```

and then execute `bundle`. 

You can also install it without Bundler:

    $ gem install konstructor

If you are a gem author or just wish to manually include `konstructor` 
keyword in your classes only when you need it, see 
[Manual include](https://github.com/snovity/konstructor/wiki/Manual-include) page.
   
## Usage

In its simplest form `konstructor` declaration creates a 
constructor from the next method.

 ```ruby
  konstructor
  def create
  end
 
  konstructor
  def recreate
  end
 ```
 
When method names are given, it creates constructors from 
those methods without affecting the next method.
 
 ```ruby
  konstructor :create, :recreate
 
  def not_constructor
  end
 
  def create
  end
 
  def recreate
  end
 ```
 
 Declaration with method names can be placed anywhere in 
 class definition.
 
 ```ruby
  def create
  end
  konstructor :create
  
  konstructor
  def recreate
  end
 ```
 
 In all above cases `SomeClass` will have the default constructor 
 and two additional ones.
 
 ```ruby
 obj0 = SomeClass.new
 obj1 = SomeClass.create
 obj2 = SomeClass.recreate
 ```
 
 If you decide to remove the default Ruby constructor for some reason,
 you can effectively do it by marking it as private using Ruby 
 method `private_class_method`:
 
 ```ruby
 class SomeClass
   private_class_method :new
 end   
 ```
  
#### Same as default constructor
 
Additional constructors work exactly the same way as the default one.

You can pass blocks to them. 

```ruby
  konstructor
  def create(val)
    @val = yield val
  end
  #...

obj = SomeClass.create(3) { |v| v*3 }
obj.val # 9
```

You can override them in subclasses and call `super`.
```ruby
class SomeClass
  konstructor
  def create(val)
    @val = val
  end
  
  attr_reader :val
end

class SomeSubclass < SomeClass
  def create(val1, val2)
    super(val1 * val2)
  end
end

obj = SomeSubclass.create(2, 3)
obj.val # 6
``` 
Once method is declared as konstructor in hierarchy, 
it is always a konstructor.

There are certain limitations to what can be declared as `konstructor`, 
see 
[Limitations page](https://github.com/snovity/konstructor/wiki/Limitations)
for details.

#### Using with other gems

Konstructor doesn't affect other gems, including those
that depend on metaprogramming, such as 
[rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake),
[thor](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor), 
[contracts](https://github.com/egonSchiele/contracts.ruby), etc.

For instnace, this is how Konstructor works with contracts:
```ruby
class SomeClass
  konstructor
  Contract Num => SomeClass
  def create(some_number)
    @number = some_number
  end
end    
```
  
If you stumble upon a metaprogramming gem that 
conflicts with Konstructor, please 
[open an issue](https://github.com/snovity/konstructor/issues/new).
  
## Details

Ruby constructor is a pair consisting of public factory method defined
on a class and a private instance method. Therefore, to achieve 
its goal `konstructor` marks instance method as private and defines a 
corresponding public class method with the same name.

#### Performance
 
Konstructor does all its work when class is being defined. Once class
has been defined, it's just standard Ruby instance creation.
Therefore, there is no runtime performance penalty. 

Konstructor doesn't depend on other gems.
  
#### Thread safety
  
Konstructor is thread safe.
