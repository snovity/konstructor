# Korolev

Minimalistic gem

Korolev allows you to have multiple constructors in Ruby with just one
simple declaration.

For details, read motivation behind this gem is in this blog post.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'korolev'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install korolev

## Usage

Constructors defined with Korolev work the same way as real Ruby 
construtors in all senses.
 
konstructor call implies private, i.e. all constructors will be private methods even if they
are declared as public.

You can place call to konstructor with names anywhere. It works similar to private, 
public calls, you can use it with symbol or without.
When used without, it will affect only the next method. When used with name, 
it can be used before and after method definition. Named and nameless declarations can be mixed.

Passing of blocks also works.

Using reserved method names 'new' and 'initialize' for custom constructor definition will raise an error.

### Inheritance

Since konstructor is a instance method, you can override it in subclass and call super as usual.

### Defining konstructors in Modules

Use ActiveSupport::Concern and define constructor in your ClassMethods or write on inlcuded hook manually.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
