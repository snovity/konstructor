    # Experimental and currently not used <code>method_added</code>
    # hook approach protecting against method_added
    # overrides that are not calling super (hopefully, there is no such code in the wild).
    #
    # Since method_added hook is idempotent, there would be no harm done even if
    # overridding method_added actually had super call and Konstructor's hook would be
    # called twice as a result of this.
