# Korolev

Minimalistic gem

Korolev allows you to have multiple constructors in Ruby with just one
simple declaration.

Custom constructors are called `konstructors` in Korolev.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'korolev'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install korolev

## Usage

Constructors defined with Korolev work the same way as real Ruby 
construtors in all senses.
 
konstructor call implies private, i.e. all constructors will be private methods even if they
are declared as public.

You can place call to konstructor with names anywhere. It works similar to private, 
public calls, you can use it with symbol or without.
When used without, it will affect only the next method. When used with name, 
it can be used before and after method definition. Named and nameless declarations can be mixed.

Passing of blocks also works.

Using reserved method names 'new' and 'initialize' for custom constructor definition will raise an error.

### Inheritance

Since konstructor is a instance method, you can override it in subclass and call super as usual. Once method is
a marked constructor in hierarchy, it is always a constructor.

Inherited methods can't be to constructor in subclass, you should define a new constructor in subclass
and reuse inherited method.

### Defining konstructors in Modules

Use ActiveSupport::Concern and define constructor in your ClassMethods or write on inlcuded hook manually.

### Reserved names
Reserved konstructor names are `new` and `initialize`, since they are used by default constructor.

### is_konstrutor?

You can always check if certain instnace method name is a constructor. It will return true for `initialize` and
all additional constructors. It will return true even if there is not such konstructor has been defined yet.

### Using with other gems

Korolev doesn't affect other gems in any way, even those that heavily depend on metaprogramming,
such as rake, thor, contracts, etc.

You can use Korolev with contracts gem, like that:
```ruby
  class YourClass
    konstructor
    Contract Num => YourClass
    def create(some_number)
      @number = some_number
    end
  end    
```
  
And also it makes little sense, you can user `korolev` inside rake and 
thor classes when defining commands and tasks.

If you stumble upon a metaprogramming gem that Korolev conflicts with,
please open [an issue](LINK TO NEW ISSUE). 
  
### Getting rid of includes
  
It is safe to include Korolev method into core Class, 
there is no perfomance penalty of any kind.
Add `require` to your gemfile declaration: 

```ruby
gem 'korolev', require: 'korolev/core_ext'
```
After that you can remove all `include Korolev` declarations and
still have `konstructor` method in all your classes. 

## Details

In Ruby constructors are actually factories and it is a pair of class and instance methods. For motivation 
behind such approach and an step by step explanation of how gem works you can read this article.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
